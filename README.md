ðŸŒ¸ Excited to explore the Iris flower dataset in my latest ML project! Using measurements like petal and sepal lengths, Iâ€™m building a model to classify species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. With Scikit-learn, Iâ€™ll experiment with techniques to sharpen my skills in data classification. Stay tuned! ðŸŒ¸ #MachineLearning
